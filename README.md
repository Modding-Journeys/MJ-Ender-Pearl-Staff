# Modding Journeys: Ender Pearl Staff!

> Inspired by the infamous `/tpa` and `/tpahere` commands created by the FTB Team!

The Ender Pearl Staff is crafted with two Sticks, two Amethyst Shards, and an Ender Pearl! 

- pretend there is an image of the recipe here lol

Using the staff will open a GUI to send and accept teleport requests to other players! Depending on their distance, the 
cost of Ender Pearls from your inventory will be proportional!
